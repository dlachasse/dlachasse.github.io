      <div class="sub-head">
        <p>I&#8217;ve put together this page to tell you about myself and list a few of my qualifications; because the thought of putting together a résumé based off some impersonal template just didn&#8217;t feel right. Please feel free to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me.</p>

    <div class="about">
      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>In the years since I graduated from high school I&#8217;ve had many thoughts about what I wanted to do with my life. In college I dabbled in subjects ranging from engineering to photography to film. My studies, life experiences and interests have helped me take a more honest perspective on my strengths &#8212; technical work.</p>

      <p>About a year ago, I made a conscious effort to invest my time into learning a programming language. Around the same time, a friend approached me about helping him build an open source bill of materials tool for 3D printing projects. So we spent some time learning PHP and mashing the thing together (<a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/repchill/tree/master/www">link</a>). The language felt all wrong, though &#8212; the syntax made it surprisingly difficult to write readable code. So I decided to try another language out. I was interested in developing for the web and had heard a little about Rails. I found a couple books (<span class="cap">rails tutorial</span> and <span class="cap">learn ruby the hard way</span>) and gleaned enough information to build an RSS reader.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="experience">
      <h2>Previous work experience</h2>
      <p>I&#8217;ve spent the past 6 years working at a small online apparel retailer selling exclusively on Amazon. I&#8217;ve had the chance to do things from printing t-shirts to desiging a proprietary warehouse inventory system.</p>

      <p>The position has provided me my first opportunity to program. When I first took the position I was tasked with building huge text inventory files in Excel and learned to automate simple actions with Visual Basic and slowly worked my way up to more complicated macros. Over time I&#8217;ve been able to create a number programs we use daily.</p>

      <p>After learning enough Ruby I was able to put together a utility to assist with some inventory synchronization issues that had been plaguing the business. I also built a couple other utilities that do some web scraping as well as log and analyze pricing changes on Amazon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="work">
      <h2>Some projects I&#8217;ve worked on</h2>
      <p>The only things I&#8217;ve written that are worth showing are in Ruby. though, I&#8217;ve written a little bit of <span class="cap">php</span>, <span class="cap">visual basic</span> and <span class="cap">visual basic .net</span>, <span class="cap">javascript</span> and just toyed with a few others. To see (a limited selection) of things I&#8217;ve worked on you can go to my Github <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse">page</a> or check out my blog <a href="http://onedrillion.com">One Drillion</a>. Here are some other snippets of code I&#8217;ve written:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9vb58t52mpf3dxz/article.rb">model</a> from the RSS reader 
        <li>A <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ew71y1ye37zbct7/mws.rb">class</a> from one of the aforementioned utilities. It is an inventory synchronization tool that interfaces with Amazon&#8217;s Merchant Web Services API</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="goals">
      <h2>Some of my goals</h2>
      <p>I have a strong desire to continue increasing abilities as a developer. I feel I can accomplish many tasks on my own. What I want to improve is an understanding of best practices, how to structure my code effectively and to be able to fully cover an application with well written tests. This is where I need mentorship or oversight from experienced engineers.</p>
