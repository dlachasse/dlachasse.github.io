      <h2>Some projects I&#8217;ve worked on</h2>
      <p>To see (a limited selection) of things I&#8217;ve worked on you can visit my Github <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse">page</a>. Here are some of my projects with code samples.</p>

      <div class="projects">
        <h3><a href="http://roasters.io">Roasters.io</a></h3>
        <p>This is my most recent work and is a project I am using as a way to force myself into the habit of <span class="cap">tdd</span>. It allows users to create a running log of roasts they&#8217;ve tried by rating them on a simple 1-10 scale.</p>
        <p>Source for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse/roasters.io">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Fulfillment by Amazon reconciliation tool</h3>
        <p>I needed to figure out how to set a flag for products that run out-of-stock at Amazon&#8217;s fulfillment centers. So I created a tool to check daily for newly out-of-stock items. It can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse/fba_reconciler">Github</a>.</p>

        <h3>Inventory Syncronizer</h3>
        <p>This is a tool I built to synchronize vendor inventory data with our local inventory. Before this was built, the process consisted of manually downloading inventory data from our vendor; formatting, verifying and combining local data; then uploading to Amazon.</p>

        <p>The utility I built now accomplishes all of this thanks to Ruby and Amazon&#8217;s Merchant <span class="cap">api</span>. We have vastly decreased our number of backorders and are able to deliver on our in-stock promise to customers.</p>

        <p>Here is a small sample <a href="https://gist.github.com/dlachasse/0850392623fad32604b5">class</a> from the utility that downloads remote inventory feeds and and normalizes them for processing. I am anxious to refactor this, but haven&#8217;t had the time to swing back around to it.</p>

    <div class="experience" id="experience">
      <h2>Previous work experience</h2>
      <p>I&#8217;ve spent the past 6 years working at a small online apparel (Blank Apparel) retailer selling on Amazon. I&#8217;ve had the chance to do things from printing t-shirts to designing, building and implementing a basic warehouse inventory system.</p>

      <p>The position has provided me my first opportunity to program. When I first took the position I was tasked with building huge text inventory files in Excel. There were a number of tedious tasks that I wanted to speed up, and discovered automation with Visual Basic. It was very empowering. I was learning new tools that could help me quickly accomplish tasks that would take an individual an inordinate amount of time. This encouraged me to learn even more and discover new uses for these newfound skills.</p>

      <h3>Additional skills</h3>
      <p>My interest lies in developing software for the web &#8212; primarily in Ruby and Javascript &#8212; but I have also used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="cap">php</span></li>
        <li><span class="cap">visual basic for applications</span></li>
        <li><span class="cap">visual basic .net</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I've been learning the ins-and-outs of Ember and Angular as well. I'm excited by the benefits these frameworks provide to help make applications snappier and more user-friendly.</p>
