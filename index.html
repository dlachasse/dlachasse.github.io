    <div class="about">
      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>Hey there, my name is David La Chasse. I'm an aspiring software developer, born and raised in the Portland, Oregon area.</p>

      <p>Towards the beginning of 2013, I decided to invest my time into learning a programming language. Around the same time, a friend approached me about helping him build an open source bill of materials tool for 3D printing projects. So we spent some time learning php and building it together (<a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/repchill/tree/master/www">link</a>). The language felt all wrong, though — the syntax made it surprisingly difficult to write readable code. So I decided to try another language out.</p>

      <p>I was primarily interested in developing for the web and had heard a little about Rails so I thought I would give it a shot. I found a couple books (<span class="cap">rails tutorial</span> and <span class="cap">learn ruby the hard way</span>) and garnered enough information begin building some of my own projects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="experience">
      <h2>Previous work experience</h2>
      <p>I&#8217;ve spent the past 6 years working at a small online apparel (Blank Apparel) retailer selling exclusively on Amazon. I&#8217;ve had the chance to do things from printing t-shirts to designing, building and implementing a basic warehouse inventory system.</p>

      <p>The position has provided me my first opportunity to program. When I first took the position I was tasked with building huge text inventory files in Excel. There were a number of tedious tasks that I wanted to speed up, and discovered automation with Visual Basic. I became obsessed with automation and optimizing broken workflows. </p>

      <p>It was very empowering. I was learning new tools that could help me quickly accomplish tasks that would take an individual an inordinate amount of time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="work">
      <h2>Some projects I&#8217;ve worked on</h2>
      <p>I&#8217;ve written a little bit of <span class="cap">php</span>, <span class="cap">visual basic</span> and <span class="cap">visual basic .net</span>, <span class="cap">javascript</span> and just toyed with a few others. To see (a limited selection) of things I&#8217;ve worked on you can visit my Github <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse">page</a> or check out my blog <a href="http://onedrillion.com">One Drillion</a>. Here are some of my projects with code samples.</p>

      <div class="projects">
        <h3>Roasters.io</h3>
        <p>This is my most recent work and is a project I am using as a way to force myself into the habit of <span class="cap">tdd</span>. It allows users to create a running log of roasts they&#8217;ve tried by rating them on a simple 1-10 scale.</p>

        <h3>Repricer</h3>
        <p>This project began as a simple test to see if I could retrieve some pricing info from the Amazon Merchant <span class="cap">api</span>. Many merchants on Amazon will price their products with little to no margin. Sometimes this is due to mismanaged repricing software. So, I put in a little bit of logic to see if it&#8217;s worth it to lower our price to stay competitive with these other sellers. Here's a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hykkujed822ziev/reprice.rb">sample</a> from it.</p>

        <h3>Fulfillment by Amazon reconciliation tool</h3>
        <p>I needed to figure out how to set a flag for products that run out-of-stock at Amazon&#8217;s fulfillment centers. So I created a tool to check daily for newly out-of-stock items. It can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse/fba_reconciler">Github</a>.</p>

        <h3>Inventory Syncronizer</h3>
        <p>This is a tool I built to synchronize vendor inventory data with our local inventory. Before this was built, the process consisted of manually downloading inventory data from our vendor; formatting, verifying and combining local data; then uploading to Amazon.</p>

        <p>The utility I built now accomplishes all of this thanks to Ruby and Amazon&#8217;s Merchant <span class="cap">api</span>. We have vastly decreased our number of backorders and are able to deliver on our in-stock promise to customers.</p>
        <p>Here is a small sample <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ew71y1ye37zbct7/mws.rb">class</a> from the utility.</p>

    <div class="goals">
      <h2>Some of my goals</h2>
      <p>I am eager to continue increasing abilities as a developer and am craving mentorship or oversight from experienced engineers. The more I&#8217;ve learned over the past year, the more I discover there is to know. There&#8217;s a wealth of knowledge to be gleaned from others.</p>
