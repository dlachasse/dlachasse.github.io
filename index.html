      <h2>Some projects I&#8217;ve worked on</h2>
      <p>To see (a limited selection) of things I&#8217;ve worked on you can visit my Github <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse">page</a> or check out my blog <a href="http://onedrillion.com">One Drillion</a>. Here are some of my projects with code samples.</p>

      <div class="projects">
        <h3><a href="http://roasters.io">Roasters.io</a></h3>
        <p>This is my most recent work and is a project I am using as a way to force myself into the habit of <span class="cap">tdd</span>. It allows users to create a running log of roasts they&#8217;ve tried by rating them on a simple 1-10 scale.</p>

        <h3>Repricer</h3>
        <p>This project began as a simple test to see if I could retrieve some pricing info from the Amazon Merchant <span class="cap">api</span>. Many merchants on Amazon will price their products with little to no margin. Sometimes this is due to mismanaged repricing software. So, I put in a little bit of logic to see if it&#8217;s worth it to lower our price to stay competitive with these other sellers. Here's a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hykkujed822ziev/reprice.rb">sample</a> from it.</p>

        <h3>Fulfillment by Amazon reconciliation tool</h3>
        <p>I needed to figure out how to set a flag for products that run out-of-stock at Amazon&#8217;s fulfillment centers. So I created a tool to check daily for newly out-of-stock items. It can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse/fba_reconciler">Github</a>.</p>

        <h3>Inventory Syncronizer</h3>
        <p>This is a tool I built to synchronize vendor inventory data with our local inventory. Before this was built, the process consisted of manually downloading inventory data from our vendor; formatting, verifying and combining local data; then uploading to Amazon.</p>

        <p>The utility I built now accomplishes all of this thanks to Ruby and Amazon&#8217;s Merchant <span class="cap">api</span>. We have vastly decreased our number of backorders and are able to deliver on our in-stock promise to customers.</p>
        <p>Here is a small sample <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ew71y1ye37zbct7/mws.rb">class</a> from the utility.</p>

      <h2>Previous work experience</h2>
      <p>I&#8217;ve spent the past 6 years working at a small online apparel (Blank Apparel) retailer selling exclusively on Amazon. I&#8217;ve had the chance to do things from printing t-shirts to designing, building and implementing a basic warehouse inventory system.</p>

      <p>The position has provided me my first opportunity to program. When I first took the position I was tasked with building huge text inventory files in Excel. There were a number of tedious tasks that I wanted to speed up, and discovered automation with Visual Basic. I became obsessed with automation and optimizing broken workflows. </p>

      <p>It was very empowering. I was learning new tools that could help me quickly accomplish tasks that would take an individual an inordinate amount of time. This encouraged me to learn even more and discover new uses for these newfound skills.</p>

      <h3>Additional skills</h3>
      <p>My interest lies in developing software for the web &#8212; primarily in Ruby &#8212; but I have also used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="cap">php</span>
        <li><span class="cap">visual basic for applications</span></li>
        <li><span class="cap">visual basic .net</span></li>
        <li><span class="cap">javascript</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>

      <p>Towards the beginning of 2013, I decided to invest my time into learning a programming language. Around the same time, a friend approached me about helping him build an open source bill of materials tool for 3D printing projects. So we spent some time learning <span class="cap">php</span> and building it together (<a href="https://github.com/dlachasse/repchill/tree/master/www">link</a>). Upon completing the project I wanted to take a step back and assess my learnings. &lsquo;The language feels awkward, and the syntax makes the code so difficult to read!&rsquo; I thought to myself. Of course, I didn't consider the possibility that readability comes down to the code&#8217;s author. So I decided to try another language out.</p>

      <p>I was primarily interested in developing for the web and had heard a little about Rails so I thought I would give it a shot. I found a couple books (<span class="cap">rails tutorial</span> and <span class="cap">learn ruby the hard way</span>) and gathered enough information begin building some of my own projects.</p>

      <p>Since this, I&#8217;ve tried find other ways to improve my knowledge: I was able to get in to RailsConf when it came through Portland; I&#8217;ve gone to Ruby meetups/talks; I met up with developer friends to talk about projects and I try to pick up a technical book from time to time. I find that there is almost no limit to what one can learn when it comes to programming.</p>
