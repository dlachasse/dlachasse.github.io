      <h2>Some projects I&#8217;ve worked on</h2>
      <p>To see (a limited selection) of things I&#8217;ve worked on you can visit my Github <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse">page</a>. Here are some of my projects with code samples.</p>

      <div class="projects">
        <h3><a href="http://roasters.io">Roasters.io</a></h3>
        <p>This is my most recent work and is a project I am using as a way to force myself into the habit of <span class="cap">tdd</span>. It allows users to create a running log of roasts they&#8217;ve tried by rating them on a simple 1-10 scale.</p>
        <p>Source for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse/roasters.io">here</a>.</p>

        <!-- <h3>Repricer</h3>
        <p>This project began as a simple test to see if I could retrieve some pricing info from the Amazon Merchant <span class="cap">api</span>. Many merchants on Amazon will price their products with little to no margin. Sometimes this is due to mismanaged repricing software. So, I put in a little bit of logic to see if it&#8217;s worth it to lower our price to stay competitive with these other sellers. Here's a <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/hykkujed822ziev/reprice.rb">sample</a> from it.</p> -->

        <h3>Fulfillment by Amazon reconciliation tool</h3>
        <p>I needed to figure out how to set a flag for products that run out-of-stock at Amazon&#8217;s fulfillment centers. So I created a tool to check daily for newly out-of-stock items. It can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dlachasse/fba_reconciler">Github</a>.</p>

        <h3>Inventory Syncronizer</h3>
        <p>This is a tool I built to synchronize vendor inventory data with our local inventory. Before this was built, the process consisted of manually downloading inventory data from our vendor; formatting, verifying and combining local data; then uploading to Amazon.</p>

        <p>The utility I built now accomplishes all of this thanks to Ruby and Amazon&#8217;s Merchant <span class="cap">api</span>. We have vastly decreased our number of backorders and are able to deliver on our in-stock promise to customers.</p>
        <p>Here is a small sample <a href="https://gist.github.com/dlachasse/0850392623fad32604b5">class</a> from the utility that downloads remote inventory feeds and and normalizes them for processing.</p>

      <h2>Previous work experience</h2>
      <p>I&#8217;ve spent the past 6 years working at a small online apparel (Blank Apparel) retailer selling exclusively on Amazon. I&#8217;ve had the chance to do things from printing t-shirts to designing, building and implementing a basic warehouse inventory system.</p>

      <p>The position has provided me my first opportunity to program. When I first took the position I was tasked with building huge text inventory files in Excel. There were a number of tedious tasks that I wanted to speed up, and discovered automation with Visual Basic. I became obsessed with automation and optimizing broken workflows. </p>

      <p>It was very empowering. I was learning new tools that could help me quickly accomplish tasks that would take an individual an inordinate amount of time. This encouraged me to learn even more and discover new uses for these newfound skills.</p>

      <h3>Additional skills</h3>
      <p>My interest lies in developing software for the web &#8212; primarily in Ruby &#8212; but I have also used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="cap">php</span>
        <li><span class="cap">visual basic for applications</span></li>
        <li><span class="cap">visual basic .net</span></li>
        <li><span class="cap">javascript</span></li>
      </ul>

    <div class="about" id="about">
      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>

      <p>I'm born and raised in Portland, Oregon and am living my wife, our new baby and three cats over in John&#8217;s Landing. In my free time I enjoy roasting coffee, listening to music, spending time with my wife and reading/writing code.</p>

      <p>I have wanted to have a job working on the web for some time now. I initially was drawn to design and somewhere along the way my interest shifted to back-end development. I had previously worked with <span class="cap">php</span>, but I wanted to try out something else. So, I decided to invest some time into learning a new language known to work well on the web. I had heard a little about Ruby and Rails so I thought I would give it a shot. I found a couple books (<span class="cap">rails tutorial</span> and <span class="cap">learn ruby the hard way</span>) and gathered enough information begin building some of my own projects.</p>
